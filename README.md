QR Reader Secure is a simple QR Reader designed and developed with a focus in privacy.

I decided to develop it after a failed search of a simple and secure reader for my parents.

The app is very simple (the aim is to scan a code and open the link, only this!) and it does not require sneaky, strange and useless permissions just for the sake of stealing your data. There aren't ads, trackers of any sort and what do you scan remains on your phone. The only requested permission is for the camera.

## Translating 🌍

QR Reader Secure currently supports Italian and English.
If you want to help QR Reader Secure becoming international, I will more than happy.

To add a new translation just add a pull request with a new `strings.xml` file inside a `values-xx` folder (where `xx` is a [two-letter ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1)).
